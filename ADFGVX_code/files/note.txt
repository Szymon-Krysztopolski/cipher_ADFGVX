Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption, converting information from a readable state to unintelligible nonsense.

The growth of cryptographic technology has raised a number of legal issues in the Information Age. Cryptography's potential for use as a tool for espionage and sedition has led many governments to classify it as a weapon and to limit or even prohibit its use and export.
